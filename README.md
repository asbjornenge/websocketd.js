# Websocketd.js

Shameless clone of [websocketd](https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd) written in javascript & compiled with [nexe](https://github.com/crcn/nexe).

Mostly cause I needed a *"missing feature"* (less security) in websocketd. Didn't want to wait. Didn't want to write any Go. And it's like 20 lines of code...

enjoy.
